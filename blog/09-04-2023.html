        <h1>Knowledge & Information</h1>
        <p>
          Noting some thoughts I had this week while camping in Algonquin park.
          These are not completely fleshed out but I wanted to record them in
          some capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group completed a 5 day backcountry trip with ~40km paddled and a
          few kms portaged. We started from Canoe Lake and camped out at Burnt
          Lake.
        </p>
        <h2>Knowledge (Epistemology)</h2>
        <p>
          I believe most people have an inner mologue. For me, my inner mologue
          is in English. For my parents (Chinese immigrents), I can guess at
          some point it was mostly Chinese with some English.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does it mean to know something? Assume it is sufficient to know
          something if the knower can explain it to a understander in objective
          words.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Alice says to Bob: "Two plus two equals four"</p>
        <h4>There are a 4 cases here:</h4>
        <p>
          Alice did know 2+2=4. Bob did know 2+2=4. Both parties know 2+2=4. No
          new knowledge has been shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice did know 2+2=4. Bob did not know 2+2=4. Bob now has the words
          necessary to explain 2+2=4 to a new person, therefore Bob now knows
          2+2=4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alice did not know 2+2=4. Bob may or may not have known 2+2=4. Either
          way, Alice has shared the words necessary to prove she knows 2+2=4.
          Both parties in this context know 2+2=4.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Alice says to Bob: "The color red is warm and apples are red."</p>
        <p>
          Not all apples are red and some hot temperatures show blue. Alice
          would have failed to explain the color red to Bob.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          Alice says to Bob: "The color red is your eyes perceiving photons
          vibrating at frequency X."
        </p>
        <p>Should be good enough.</p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Something something, the end goal here may be: A fact bank + a random
          generative model, may be sufficient to rift upon and prove new truthy
          ideas.
        </p>
        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          The internet is an invention for humans to share information quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should exist some function that represents the value of
          information.
        </p>
        <p>v(i,t) = $ value of information i at time t</p>
        <p>v(i,t) = c(i,t) + p(i,t)</p>
        <p>
          c(i,t) = $ cost of transfering information i at time t (internet
          highways cost money)
        </p>
        <p>
          p(i,t) = $ an information premium at time t (passwords are more
          valuable than lorem ipsum!)
        </p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>We may be able to generalize the cost of all information.</p>
